The Preference Form will only be displayed to authneticated users. 
Only newly registered users fill out this form, and their set preferences will be populated in the profile page. As of right now, if a user would like to update their preferences, they must re-fill out the form displayed in the dashboard. 

Once the form is filled out it populates the preferences table in the database. Since the matching algorithm focuses on the profiles table, there is a trigger and function on the database that automatically updates the characteristics(preferences) column in the Profiles table from the updated Preferences table based on userId.

    -- Return the new row for the insert to complete
    RETURN NEW;
