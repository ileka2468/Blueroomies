## **2. Initial Key Features (by Developer Focus Area and Feature Group)**

### **Feature Group: Messaging, Notifications, Agreements**

##### Developers: Cristian (Backend) and Matthew (Frontend/Database)

- Matthew - Frontend components for messaging page, agreement page, and notification system.
- Cristian - Backend, enabling messaging services between matched users, setting up notifications to alert users when new matches are found, etc. Creating agreement between users when establishing roommate partnership. Additional features as the project progresses.

### **Feature Group: Authentication, Roommate Matching, Search/Filtering**

##### Developers: William (Lead/Flex) and Nathan (Backend/Database)

- Nathan - Backend and database configurations/setup. Utilizing statistical models to determine an efficient roommate matching system, and write microservices for server to database interactions for search/filter operations to be utilized by frontend components.
- William - In addition to setting up requiremnts, documentation, and architecture for the project I'll be working on both the Spring backend and React frontend for authentication, roommate matching, and search/filtering features. For the backend, Iâ€™ll handle setting up authentication using JWT, and work with Nate on the matchmaking algo for roommate matching.

### **Profile Management, Preferences**

##### Developers: Harshita (Backend/Frontend/Database) and Saqib (Backend/Frontend/Database)

## **4. Conflict Resolution Strategy**

### **Code Conflicts**:

- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Each dev should work on their own feature branch, which will eventually be merged into the `main` branch through a pull request.
- **Pull Request Process**:
  1. Before opening a PR, developers must **pull the latest changes** from `main` into their feature branch to minimize potential conflicts:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git checkout feature/your-feature
     git merge main
     ```
  2. If conflicts arise during the merge, the developer is responsible for resolving them in their feature branch.
  3. Once conflicts are resolved, the developer updates the branch and pushes the changes to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
     git push origin feature/your-feature
     ```
  4. The PR is then reviewed by other team members, and after approval, the feature branch is merged into `main`.

### **Disagreements on Code or Features**:

- If there is a disagreement regarding the implementation or functionality during the pull request review, the following steps will be taken:
  1. Discuss the issue in the PR comments or during the next scheduled meeting and solve it with a dicord poll.

## **5. Communication Mechanism**

- **Primary Tool**:
  - **Discord Server**: The team will use Discord for communication.

## **7. Key Decisions**

- **Editor**:  
  The team can use whatever IDE's or text-editors they are comfortable with but thre recommended editor will be Intelij **IDEA Ultimate Edition** for Java and Spring Boot code and **Visual Studio Code** for Frontend/React code.
- **Project Scope**:  
  The final project scope includes user authentication, profile management, roommate matching, and messaging.
