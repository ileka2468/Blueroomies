### Meeting Agenda (1 Hour)

1. **Milestone 1 Progress & Repo Check-in (25 min)**:

   - Confirm that repository and persistence for all backend code are either done or actively in progress.
   - **Repo Check-in**: Make sure everyone is pushing their branches to the remote repository regularly. We need visibility on progress—if it’s only on your local machine, we can’t track it.
   - Address any blockers or issues to keep everyone on track for the Sunday deadline.

2. **Live Code Review & Integration (30 min)**:

   - Walk through key sections of code and integration points.
   - Review how the different parts are coming together and ensure everything is in sync.

3. **Next Steps (5 min)**:
   - Finalize any outstanding tasks.
   - Reminder about the milestone deadline on Sunday.
